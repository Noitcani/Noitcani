# Iâ€™m @Noitcani


I created this repo to document my journey...   
this road to reinvent myself 
and to take control over the next phase of my career trajectory. 
  
  
For too long have I marvelled at the growth of the Tech industry, 
while doing nothing to open doors for myself to be part of it.
  
  
These first steps were driven by neccesity <br> - a growing discomfort of stagnation that has finally compelled me to action.
  
  
I can't say for sure if I am already too old to succeed in such a drastic vocational change now, 
but I am definintely too young to not try.

## **Let's go.**
